# Important terms and concepts
## Population vs sample

- population: the complete set of items that interest the investigator (N)
- sample: the observed subset (portion) of a population (n)

*Why do we need a sample? Why don't we just study the whole population?* \- Because of 2 factors: size and time constraints

## Random sampling vs systematic sampling

- random sampling: the procedure in which n objects are chosen from a population N totally by chance, the selection of one object does not influence the selection of any other object.
- systematic sampling (including stratified sampling and cluster sampling): the procedure in which the selection of objects is done with jth item from a population, where j = N/n. Randomly pick a number from 1 to j to obtain the first item to be included in the systematic sampling.

## Sampling errors vs Nonsampling errors
- parameter: numerical measure that describe the characteristic of a population N
- statistic: numerical measure that describe the characteristic of a sample n

- sampling errors are caused by sampling procedure:
  + the population and the sample are not relevant
  + survey subjects give inaccurate answers or are dishonest
  + no response to the questions

- nonsampling errors are caused not by the procedure of selection of objects from a population but by other procedures like designing questionnaires, analyzing data.

## Descriptive vs Inferential statistics
- descriptive statistics: focus on graphical and numerical procedures that summarize and process data
- inferential statistics: focus on using data to make predictions, forecasts, and estimates to make better decisions

*Running a regression is a descriptive or inferential statistics?" - 

# Classification of variables
- 2 common ways of classifying variables:

  + categorical vs numerical
  + qualitative vs quantitative
  
## Categorical vs Numerical
- Categorical variables: responses to categorical variables belong to groups or categories (yes/no question, gender, marital status, Likert scale)
- Numerical variables:
  + discrete variables: produced (usually) by a counting process
  + continuous variables: take value within a given range and usually produced by a measurement process
  
## Qualitative vs Quantitative
- Qualitative variables: nominal vs ordinal levels of measurement (no measurable meaning to the difference between responses)
- Quantitative variables: interval vs ratio levels of measurement (difference between response has measurable meaning)

# Graphs to describe categorical variables
- frequency distribution vs relative frequency distribution:
  + FD: comes in absolution value, described by bar chart
  + RFD: comes in percentage, described by pie chart

- Cross tables (crosstab, contingency table): is to list the observations for every combination of values for 2 different categorical/ ordinal variable.We can use component bar chart or cluster bar chart to visualize cross tables

- Pareto diagram: is a *bar chart* that displays the *frequency of defect causes* and orders them in a descending manner. This helps to separate the "vital view" from the "trivial many".
